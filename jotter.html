Animating Vur Router Transitions.

    How Transition Element works
    <div>
        The transition element sets up different hooks and adds classes to your changing elements so that we can style
        them through out the different state of trsnition

        There are two main set of transition classes

        1. The Enter classes
        <div>
            The classes are listed here

            1. .v-enter-from
            \This sets the start state of the transition and is removed once our transition starts

            2. .v-enter-to
            \This sets the end state of the transition

            3. .v-enter-active
            \This controls our transitions while its active
        </div>


        2. The leave classes
        <div>
            The classes are listed here

            1. .v-leave-from
            \This sets the start state of the transition and is removed once our transition starts

            2. .v-leave-to
            \This sets the end state of the transition

            3. .v-leave-active
            \This controls our transitions while its active
        </div>


        These classes are the default names for a transition element meaning if we dont name our transition as in if we
        dont give our <transition name=""> transition name attribute a value its default will just be the (v)

            But if you give it a name e.g <transition name="fade"> the classes will become
                1. .fade-enter-from
                2. .fade-enter-to
                3. .fade-enter-active

                1. .fade-leave-from
                2. .fade-leave-to
                3. .fade-leave-active

    </div>

    Modes
    <div>
        We have three types of Modes
        1. Default Mode
        \Where the two elements are transitioning at the same time (the elements that are leaving and the new element
        that is coming in when you switch pages)

        2. out-in Mode
        \Where the new element fades in and the old element fades out (the elements that are leaving and the new element
        that is coming in when you switch pages)

        3. out-in Mode
        \Where the old elements first will fade out and the the new element will fade in
    </div>

    CODE
    <code>
        <script setup>
            import { RouterView, RouterLink } from "vue-router";
        </script>
            
            <template>
            
                <nav>
                    <RouterLink to="/">Home</RouterLink>
                    <RouterLink to="/about">About</RouterLink>
                </nav>
            
                <RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
                    <transition name="fade" mode="out-in">
                        <component :is="Component" />
                    </transition>
                </RouterView>
            
            </template>
            
            <style>
                .fade-enter-from,
                .fade-leave-to {
                    opacity: 0;
                }
            
                .fade-enter-active,
                .fade-leave-active {
                    transition: opacity 0.5s ease-out;
                }
            </style>
